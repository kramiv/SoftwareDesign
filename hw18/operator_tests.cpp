//Um, attempt this later.
//I would input something like 
//double w = 8 + pippin;
//which requires a standalone function for a fucntion
//like this:
//double operator+(Hobbit h, int x) {  // stand-alone function
//  return h.height + x;
//}
//Then, I would also have input for main:
//I would input something like
//operator+(pippin, 2);
//and then have a methods defining this operator.
//yeah this should work with the 3 requirements.
