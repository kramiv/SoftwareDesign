CQ1: for Food1.cpp
Do these classes require a copy constructor or assignment
operator to prevent memory allocation errors?  Why or why not? 
    copy constructor = creates a copy at new location
    assignment operator = assigns new values
    Well, if dealing with dynamic allocation or with assigning variables,
    both can be used as with a regular class I think.
