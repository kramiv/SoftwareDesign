Exercise CQ1:
    class needs a define copy contsructor because there is no array
    to keep track of in memory and delete in order, create in order,
    use in order, change class variables without changing original 
    ones.
Exercise CQ2:
    I'm not sure I understand this question.
    h(); inside main and then void h('Note')?
    In this case, it would directly affect the Note used.
Exercise CQ3:
    We need to use a parameter to reference the class's values
    and copy them.
Exercise CQ4:
    it is called at the end of main
Exercise CQ5:
     yes - this is how a copyconstructor gets its own set of data
    that it can change or delete without changing original copied set.
