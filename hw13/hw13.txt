Exercise:  Please put your answer to this question in a 
file called hw13.txt How is it different to add text
 directly to the mem area on the right (just typing in the 
 letters), versus typing in text on the left into a
  TextInput?  (Hint:  there are two differences in what
   happens.)

If you type in on the left side, you have to press enter
for the mem box to have these characters.
From the mem box, though, changes are updated to the left side
immediately
