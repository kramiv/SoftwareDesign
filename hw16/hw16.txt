Exercise (CQ1):  What is a situation where you might want to start with an array of one size, and later change it to an array of a different size?  Please write your answer in hw16.txt.
    Ah. item_price.cpp has an example. 

Exercise CQ2: Explain why the program would appear to run just fine, if we left out the call to delete inside the change_items function.
    Hm. I don't know for sure, but would only the 
    third new array value get added? Other new ones
    don't get recorded at all?

Exercise CQ3:
It is organized to modify an array all at once. By
clearing it right before refilling it, you keep track 
whether it's available.

void f() {
  int n = 3;
  // ... more code
  //this deletes it after each time the function call is complete
}
void f2() {
  int *p = new int;
  *p = 3;
  // ... more code
  //this keeps assigning a new integer over and over
}
void f3() {
  int *p = new int;
  *p = 3;
  // ... more code
  delete p;
}//add "delete p;" to delete after each function call.
