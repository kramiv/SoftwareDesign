/*
Whenever you are about to start writing code, open a terminal on one of the lab machines.  
In that terminal, type the following command:
  /usr/local/dept/bin/sd start
  
 Then, later, when you are done coding for awhile, enter the following command:

  /usr/local/dept/bin/sd stop
  
  
As long as you email me within 24 hours, I'm happy to fix or update any journal entries.  
For example, if you accidentally forgot to 'start' an entry, or if one of the entries 
didn't get recorded because of a disk quota issue.
On a class day with no other homework, the expectation is for about 2.5 hours of project time.
