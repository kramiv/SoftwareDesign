yes but to start actually building it during lab
okay just brainstorming here:
the whole webpage is a bunch of buttons. just tile of buttons.
user clicks on them like chess
that is simple enough.
We can make the buttons be associated with an enemy for now
maybe by making the button an enemy stands on cause damage
we can then change the character's health bar by  - 5 health or soemthing
and update the yaml accordingly
how does that sound to start?

I feel like that is rather clunky and a bit problematic if we do all buttons. There would have to be events of clicking buttons not adjacent to you which leads to many more problems. I think we need to do keyboard listeners since updating the position will be easy for the character. You just offset it by a certian amount of pixels (however many pixels a tile in the grid is) and redraw it there

I have no idea what that is and I am basically asking for concrete directions
what kind of code does that look like?
that was something I wanted to ask Olaf about, but if you know how to do something like that, we can get started. What is it?

I used keyboard listeners in java in the past so I can look into that. So you know how we had listeners for the event of a button being clicked on the screen right? Well it is a similar concept but it is for a certain key input on the keyboard
I just need to figure out how to do it in C++
From Me to Gage Olson:  (Privately) 03:53 PM
we can ask about that
do you want to do that now?
btw we probably don't need a breakout room if we're just private messaging.
