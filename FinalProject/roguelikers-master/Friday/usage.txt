1rst page: gives name of game. Click on button to proceed. 
    It should display "Proceed" but I did not have time to fix this.

2nd page: Homepage. For now, it only has an option to stare a new run.
    We originally wanted a way to store a few runs and open them.
There is also a button for settings. This would theoretically adjust
    things like volume of game music. For now, it is just a button.

3rd page: Hub. 3 buttons: upgrades shop, a clothing shop, and the 
    dungeon. 
The upgrades shop leads to a new webpage that should
    have a working button that call functions that should lower the 
    player's gold and then increase the player's speed (just have 
    the player move a bit farther each time the position is updated
    based on key input).
The clothing shop is just a button. It was supposed to open a clothing
    shop yaml where the user could purchase new skins by calling 
    functions that lower the user's gold and change the color of the
    user's character in the game.
The dungeon button leads to the dungeon yaml and calls SetUpRoom().

Dugneon button:
This is the actual gameplay. There is keyboard functionality that
    updates the user's character's position and updates gold based on
    detected conflict. 
    We wanted to work on expanding gameplay and making it more interesting.
There should be a button to return to the Hub, but I can not get it to 
    work for more than one user action so far. 

After we are capable of creating a multi-room dungeon, we wanted
to find a way to generate new combinations of dungeon rooms for each
new time opening the entire game.
