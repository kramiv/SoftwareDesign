Please read for which files to view:
This project is, admittedly, much more disorganized than I would like. This was my first real coding course where I created multiple-page programs. My partners and I collaborated using multiple files and file types to create a very simple game for our final project.

The bulk of the game's functionality is in the file FinalProject/roguelikers-master/Friday/gagecode.cpp
