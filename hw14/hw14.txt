Explanation of what happens in hello3.cpp:

Initial page will have two boxes:
top box = abcd (0 1 2 3 4)
bottom = zyx (5 6 7 8)

Once the page is interacted with, character starting
from (1) which is b will be displayed at the bottom 
box and in global mem (5)

The top box that can't be edited will still display
abcd (actually bcd but not sure why). 
It keeps tacking it on but leaves off soem character
